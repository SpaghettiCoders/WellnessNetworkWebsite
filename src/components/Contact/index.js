              <p>It has been said that the “mind” is the pinnacle of God’s creation.  If that is in fact true, how do we change hopelessness and reduce stress and its related illnesses?  How do we create an environment which cultivates health and happiness through mindfulness?</p>
              <p>I am Pamela Koons, Executive Director of At The WELLness Network, (ATW) a Gainesville, Florida based 501(c)(3) not for profit corporation, with a focus on health and wellness for families in our deserving communities.</p>
              <p>I am also a Certified Bikram Yoga Instructor and a Certified Core Coach - Yoga Fundamentals, Yoga2Life Coach and the host of At The WELLnessRadioTV, a weekly FB and YouTube, taking you On The Road To WELLness with thought provoking stories and interviews.</p>
              <p>I am a God fearing woman who loves the physical, mental and spiritual benefits of Yoga as well as examining how my eating habits contribute to how I look and feel.</p>
              <p>I have been practicing Bikram Yoga for 11 years and Yoga2Life coaching for three years.   While attending Bikram Yoga classes in studios across the country, I have noticed that the demographic of the participants is always the same, very few, if any people of color, and no spaces conducive to families practicing together.  The reasons why may vary, from never considering Yoga as a form of exercise and its benefits, to not having the resources for Yoga classes.</p>
              <p>One of our goals is to take this ancient discipline of Yoga available to people by offering classes to families in public housing communities and other facilities in our deserving communities.  In addition to taking Yoga to the people, we plan to build a Yoga studio with donation only Yoga classes every Friday.  We encourage yogis from a cross section of our community to increase their circulation and quite their minds by practicing Yoga.</p>
              <p><strong>Sisters of WELLness</strong> was born out of a desire to bring the “Givers of Life,” women, together by encouraging them to take the lead in changing the health picture of their homes one meal at a time.  We are asking women to take their families for a 30-minute walk, just three times a week and to take inventory of what goes on the plates of their families at mealtime.   Start a plan to move away from the Standard American Diet (SAD).  SAD is filled with processed food, chemicals and toxins.  These toxins lead to health disease, cancer, high blood pressure, heart disease, obesity, premature aging and many other diseases.</p>
              <p>Our <strong>Juneteenth Health Freedom 5K Run/Walk</strong> brings runners, walkers and wheelers from a cross section of our community to a day of celebrating victories in overcoming health challenges, while moving in a direction to learn how to prevent stress, obesity, diabetes, high blood pressure, heart disease, cancer and other preventable diseases.</p>
              <p>I spent the first 25 years of my career as a broadcast journalist.   At The WELLnessRadioTV gives me the opportunity to combine my passion for health and wellness with the skills acquired as a Radio/TV Talk Show Host, Anchor and Reporter.   Our goal is to enlighten viewers and listeners by bringing to them stories and advice from global leaders in health, wellness and holistic living.  We will help save lies and bring back a quality of life by teaching the freedom of forgiveness, so we can live a whole, powerful, strong, loving and harmonious life.</p>
              <p>Thank you for allowing ATW to be a part of this journey with you.</p>
              <p>We look forward to hearing and sharing your story and seeing you in a Yoga class.</p>
              <p>Thanks for watching and listening.</p>
              <p>As We Move Forward,</p>
