                    I am the 11th of 13 children.  A few years ago, I read a story that proclaimed that we would be the first generation that would not live as long as our parents.  I thought, with all of the advances in healthcare, how is that possible?  Then in a five year period, my three oldest brothers died.  All three of my brothers served in the United States Army.  War on the battlefield didn't take their lives.  My three brothers are dead because of food related illnesses.  My three brothers died before reaching my parentâ€™s age at the time of their deaths.  
                    As I continued to watch loved ones die, I felt a calling to find leaders in the healthcare and holistic community to help teach us how to take care of the vessel...our bodies.  We formed <b>At The WELLness Network, Inc.</b> to help inform men, women, boys and girls that we can take control of our health through better nutrition, reducing stress and adding yoga and other forms of exercise to our daily lives. 
                    At The WELLness Network, Inc. birthed <b>At The WELLnessRadioTV</b> as a vehicle, a ministry to help free people from the bondage of food and food related diseases.
